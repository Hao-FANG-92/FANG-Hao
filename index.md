# Biography

I am currently a software engineer at an autonomous driving company [Moonx](http://www.moonx.ai/#/home).  My major work focus on Perception and Prediction module using deep learning techniques. I did my PhD at Team [TITANE](https://team.inria.fr/titane/team/) of [INRIA Sophia-Antipolis](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-sophia-antipolis-mediterranee) in the filed of 3D Computer Vision and Computer Graphics advised by [Florent LAFARGE](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Florent.Lafarge/). Before that, I received my master and bachelor degree of Beihang University. As well, I spent the last year of the Engineer Program at Ecole Centrale Paris majored in Applied Mathematics. 

My research interest mainly lies in 3D Computer Vision and geometric modeling,  which include semantic segmentation, shape detection, surface reconstruction using optimization-based and deep learning methods.
